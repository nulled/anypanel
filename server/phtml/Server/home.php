A <b>Masterpiece of Software Engineering</b>. <i>Primarily</i> coded by <u><i>Volunteers</i></u> when not at their day job.
Often Day Jobs are unforfilling without Freedom, but Off-The-Clock they Code whatever their imaginations please them.
Then there are the types that want to leverage portions of the Free Software World by paying programmers. They are allowed
to leverage Open Source, because under the Free Software Licences Agreement, You <b>must</b> put your code back into the Code Bases
so others can do with it as You have.  Equal Rights in other words. Unfortunetly, some have tried to not share the Code
and some have been sued. Finally, there are some Software Projects that start out 100% Closed but go bankrupt.  The owners then chose
to give the Code away to the Open Source Community, instead of deleting it out of existance.  Blender (A Professional 3D Graphics Program)
is a good example of Software starting off 100% closed and for profit, yet ending up in the Public Code Base, called Free and Open Source.
<br /><br />
Either contributed by Volunteers or from Business ventures will always results in the Code being placed into the larger Code Base.
The beauty of the <b>CopyLeft Licencing Terms</b> results in all Code being preserved, regardless of the Situation.  Open and Free
Source is some of the most Optimized (fast) and Secure (well written) Code yet devised by the Human Family.

<h2 class="pageheader"><b>AnyPanel for Automation</b></h2>

<b>AnyPanel</b> aims to allow a <i>complete Novice</i> the ability to set up a Web, Mail and File Server.  Hiring a Linux System
Administrator can cost 100's of Thousands of Dollars a Year not only to set up your Operation, but to also keep it running smoothly and
Up-to-Date, and finally, Monitored for Maximum Uptime.  <i>AnyPanel never sleeps</i>, it is there at your Beck and Call, and without
the need for Lunch Breaks, Social Alignment or Health Care.  AnyPanel will not talk down or back to You!  It will love you as much
as it You will love it, because it just works and never skips a beat.
<br /><br />
<b>The <i>Manufacturing Sector</i> of the <i>Economy</i></b> are now building Robots to produce anything imaginable. Doing away with
<i>Unappreciated Young <b>Chinese Girls</b></i> working in assemble lines building iPhones.  The Public Backlash prompted
Apple Computer Inc., to do two things, one of which is going to be an unstopable trend that will ignite other Companies to do the same
in order to keep up.  Apple spent <b>Billions of Dollars on a robotics Manufaturing Plant</b>, not filled with people, but with Robots.
If you take a few hours to let this sink in. It could become either terrifying or a Renaissance on a Global Scale.
<br /><br />
<b><i>AnyPanel</i></b> aspires to do the same thing, by replacing Human Administrators and Programmers with Point and Click Graphics while
the Smarts are all happening <i>under-the-hood</i>.  Like Self-Transforming-Machine-Elfs living in your Computer. Times are changing and
things are moving faster and faster as we enter in a New Age of Enlightenment that may one day Free Man and Woman from the every day toils
of mondane and Life sapping Laborious Jobs.
<br /><br />
<u>Automation</u> <i>with the ability to Adapt to changes</i>. For better or for worse.
