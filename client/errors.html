    <h3 class="toggler">Error 100</h3>
    <div class="element">
        ssh2_connect failed: Ensure OpenSSH or the SSH package is installed and accessible on your Server.
        <br /><br />
        First, ensure the IP Address you set in DigiPanel is the IP Address of your Server!
        <br /><br />
        Second, ensure that SSH is installed and running on your server. SSH allows remote access to your Server.
        <br /><br />
        Third, ensure that SSH (Secure SHell) is accessible on port 22 of your Server and is <i>not</i> blocked by any
        firewalls you may have set up. On Ubuntu Servers run the following commands to allow SSH connections.
        <pre>
            sudo ufw enable
            sudo ufw allow 22
        </pre>
        Install SSH on your Server. Depending on which Linux Server you are running will determine how to install SSH.
        <br />
        <p>
            Ubuntu Server: <b>sudo apt-get install <i>ssh</i></b>
            <br />
            CentOS Server: <b>yum install <i>ssh</i></b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="toggler">Error 101</h3>
    <div class="element">
        ssh2_auth_password failed: Ensure root user has access vai an ssh login.
        <br /><br />
        First, insure you have your correct <i>root</i> user password set for DigiPanel and your server!
        <br />
        If, the above is confirmed correct and DigiPanel still can not access your Server, see below.
        <br /><br />
        <b>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</b> - edit this file to ensure the following options are set.
        <pre>
            PermitRootLogin Yes
        </pre>
        <b>Note:</b> For Ubuntu servers, the root user does not have a password set, after a default install.
        You need to become the root user, then set a password for it. The first command <i>sudo -s</i> will
        make you root user. The second command <i>passwd your_password_here</i> will prompt and confirm a new
        password for root user. After the password has been set, you can issue the command <i>exit</i> to return
        to your normal user.
        <pre>
            sudo -s
            passwd your_password_here
            exit
        </pre>
    </div>

    <h3 class="toggler">Error 200</h3>
    <div class="element">

        <br /><br />
        Your distribution install is corrupt or tampered with and a reinstall is recommended. If you are running a
        Linux distribution that DigiPanel does not support you can ignore this error. DigiPanel supports the top major
        Linux Distributions such as; Ubuntu Server, CentOS/RHEL and Debian Server.
